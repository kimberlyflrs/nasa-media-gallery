## NASA Search Gallery 
Look up thousands of images, video, and audio courtesy of the NASA Image and Video API.

## Motivation
I wanted to make a tool that would explore the use of an API. The NASA API caught my attention due to the variety of media files available to access. I thought it would be fun to create a tool that would allow others to view these resourcces through a simple search.

## Features
- Search through Nasa's available images, videos, and audios
- Filter and Sort the results
- View descriptive information over each result
